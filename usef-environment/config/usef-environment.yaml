##########################################################################################################################
# Exponential backoff is an algorithm that retries requests to the server based on certain status codes in the

# comes back up. See also: https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/wiki/ExponentialBackoff

# The message precedence is part of the message metadata which can be set to ROUTINE, TRANSACTIONAL or
