### Coding guidelines
Our unified coding guidelines and the descriptions of the most important technical solutions required for the development on the project are provided below.
#### General package name conventions:
* Start package: all package names should start with `info.usef`
* Singulars: all package names should be logical singulars without capitals

#### Service class names:
* Web Services (SOAP, RESTFull etc)
    * Package: `info.usef.core.service.endpoint.<...>` 
    * Name: `<Logical Name>Endpoint Example: info.usef.core.service.endpoint.MessageEndpoint`
* Message Driven Beans:
    * Package: `info.usef.core.service.mdb.<…> `
    * Name: `<Logical Name>MDB` 
    * Example: `info.usef.core.service.endpoint.MessageEndpoint`
* Business services (business logic implementation)
    * Package: `info.usef.core.service.business.<...>` 
    * Name: `<Logical Name>BusinessService` 
    * Example: `info.usef.core.service.business. MessageBusinessService`
* Some technical or helper services:
    * Package: `info.usef.core.service.helper.<…> `
    * Name: `<Logical Name>HelperService`
    * Example: `info.usef.core.service.jms.JMSHelperService`

#### Repository classes
* Naming:
    * Package: `info.usef.core.repository.<...>` 
    * Name: `<Logical Name>Repository` 
    * Example: `info.usef.core.repository.error. MessageErrorRepository`
* Superclass: all repository classes should extend the `info.usef.core.repository.BaseRepository` class.

#### Utility classes
* Naming:
    * Package: `info.usef.core.util.<...>` 
    * Name: `<Logical Name>Util` 
    * Example: `info.usef.core.util.XMLUtil`
* Methods: all public utility methods should be implemented as static methods unless there is a specific reason to do this in the other way.

#### XML Bean classes 
* Classes corresponding to root elements:
    * Package: `info.usef.core.data.xml.bean.<...>` 
    * Name: `<XML Root Element Name> `It is advisable, if there is no specific reason to do this differently, to put all beans representing root elements directly into the `info.usef.core.data.xml.bean` package Example: `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?><TestMessage>...</TestMessage>info.usef.core.data.xml.bean.TestMessage`

#### Persistant Bean classes
* Package: `info.usef.core.data.model.bean.<...> Name: <DB Table Name without underscore symbols>`. Capitals should be substituted with small letters if they are not in the begining of a word.

#### DB Tables
All table names should be logical singulars in capitals split with underscore symbols if a name is composed from different names.

    git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
    ```

* Create your patch.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.

    ```shell
    git commit -a
    ```
  Note: the optional commit `-a` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

* [Build](https://github.com/USEF-Foundation/ri.usef.energy/blob/master/usef-doc/USEF%20The%20Framework%20Implemented%20-%20Installation%20Manual.docx) your changes locally to ensure all the tests pass.
* Push your branch to GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin my-fix-branch
    ```

In GitHub, send a pull request to `ri.usef.energy:master`.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
